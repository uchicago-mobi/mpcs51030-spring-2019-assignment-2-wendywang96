### Comments

Nice job with functionality, you've got everything working as it should.

On line 63 of your view controller, you write "for i in 0...2". This is static and non-
maintanable. We like to be as dynamic as possible in our coding. If another animal gets
added to the zoo, unless we remember to update this number, the 4th animal will never show
up. If an animal leaves the zoo, we have a much worse problem. The app would crash with
an index out-of-range error. How can we be more dynamic? Like this:

for i in 0..<animals.count {

OR

for (i, animal) in animals.enumerated() { 
// this tuple gives you both the Int i and the animal object at that index. Handy!

Lines 97-104 decide whether to write "year" or "years" based on whether the animal is 1
year old. This customization is a nice touch. You can actually write it in one line,
using what we call a "ternary conditiinoal operator". Here it is in action:

let yearOrS = animal.age == 1 ? "year" : "years"

The format of a ternary conditional operator is:

conditional statement ? action if true : action if false

Where "?" acts as the "if" half of the statement, and ":" acts as the "else".

Well-Formatted:

Your Animal struct should be in its own file. It is completely distinct from the view
controller.

Best Practice:

Your viewDidLoad method in ViewController.swift is performing multiple different tasks.
This is a method where multiple tasks will happen, but we should split the code for those 
tasks into helper methods. Here's an example of how we could make this code more 
encapsulated and more readable:

Task 1: populateAnimalsArray()
Task 2: configureButtonsAndImageViews()

Now, viewDidLoad looks like this:

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
 
    // some miscellaneous small-task code

    populateAnimalsArray()
    configureButtonsAndImageViews()
}

Much cleaner! Note that the names of these methods tell you exactly what they do. That
indicates a method is well-named.

A second method that could benefit from splitting its functionality into helpers is the
buttonTapped method. How many distinct tasks is that method performing, and what would be
good names for the helper methods you can create?
